# OpenTripPlanner Setup
Before running the software, you must have a running version of Open Trip Planner (OTP) on a machine. For OTP installation refer to the [Basic Tutorial](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/latest/Basic-Tutorial/) using the [GTFS data](https://data.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/explore/dataset/offre-horaires-tc-gtfs-idf/information/) from IdF-Mobility and the [OSM data](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/france/ile-de-france.html) for the Ile-de-France region.

After you download the jar file of OTP, place it into FOLD. As for the GTFS data of Ile-de-France, you need to download a csv file where you will find the link to download a zip file. Place this zip file in FOLD. As for Open Street Map (OSM) data, you need to download a pbf file, from the website indicated above, and place it into FOLD.

Run OTP as explained in the tutorial. If you get an "Out of memory" exception, try to increase the memory limits, specified in the parameters. For instance, I needed to give 8GB to OTP to make it run for ÃŽle de France.

# Library installation

The script uses two external libraries: libcurl and jansson. To install them (on Linux):

1. Download the libraries from the official website ([libcurl](https://curl.se/download.html), [jansson](http://digip.org/jansson/releases/)). Extract them into a folder of your choice. I've used libcurl 7.75.0 and jansson 2.13

2. For each of the two libraries above, go to their respective folder. Then, use the following commands :

```
./configure
make 
make check
sudo make install
```

Then, install again libcurl (true, it is redundant, but if I did not install the two versions of libcurl, I had problem in compilation and/or linking phase)

```
sudo apt-get install libcurl3
```
# Compilation

Compile script.cpp. On Ubuntu 18.04, the following command on the command line worked:
```
gcc factorized_script.cpp -lcurl -ljansson -lstdc++ -o script
```

You may need to add the paths to the libs by adding : 
```
-I path/to/jansson-2.13/src -I path/to/curl-7.75.0/include
```

# Usage

Use the process.sh bash file to execute the script. 

```
bash process.sh
```
It takes the data for the department codes that are of interest to us (i.e. Ile-de-France) and uses the included coordinates to calculate accessibility. Accessibility of A is calculated as the average travel time from all other point to the point A. A couple of gps coordinates have been modified by hand since they were in inaccessible places (rivers, lakes, airport). Possibility to use a multi-processus computation. If so, use merge_csv.sh to merge all csvs into one.

# Visualization

Visualization is done in Python using folium. It uses geo data form a gouverment [dataset](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/apur-communes-ile-de-france/#_) and populates with the accessibility values from the script to build an gradient map of accessibility.

There are 2 files regarding the type of map we want to compute (choropleth or ponctual).
